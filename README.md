## API

### 1.Â ZKBarrier

like [CyclicBarrier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html), ZKBarrier allows a set of thread to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.

* `ZKBarrier` : a barrier with a group name and thread entry count.
* `ZKBarrierEntry` : generated from a `ZKBarrier`, stands for a waiting group member.
  * `enter()` : enter the group waiting.
  * `leave()` : leave the group waiting.  Entries can resume  execution only after all entries have leaved.

You can find a usage in [here](https://github.com/robynhan/Bottle/blob/master/src/test/java/org/robyn/lib/zookeeper/coredomain/ZKBarrierEntryTest.java).

### 2. Queue

Queue holds a theme, and producer can produce items to the theme, and the consumers can retrieve items from the theme.

* `Queue` : a queue with a theme .
  * `produce(int value)` :   put a item to the queue.
  * `int consume()` : retrieve the frist item in the queue. 

For a production-grade queue, you will need add count limit.
